Hello!

My name is Jos√© Maia. I'm a software developer from the north of Portugal, deeply passionate about a bunch of things, such as pro wrestling, video games, history and DevOps.

I setup this blog so I'd have a place to post about interesting things that happen to me during the working week that I can share with other people, as well as random thoughts and reviews of media.
